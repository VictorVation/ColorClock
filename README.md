# ColorClock
A Chrome New Tab color clock. Shows a different colour for each second in the day e.g. if the time is 12:34:01, then the background and favicon will be the color `#123401`.

Get it on the Chrome Web Store - [ColorClock Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorclock-tabs/ajhlmmkocpickopfnjdbapohpjllghpo). 

## About
Inspired by a post I saw on [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/what-color-is-it) - someone mentioned that it'd be a cool New Tab replacement, and I thought so too - so I made it. A lot of these are floating around right now - mine is different because of the color changing favicon and (IMO) more readable code.

If you want to know what's going on, the guts of this are in [ext/js/clock.js](https://github.com/VictorVation/ColorClock/blob/master/ext/js/clock.js). If you don't want to download it, you can check out what it looks like on [rawgit](http://cdn.rawgit.com/VictorVation/ColorClock/master/ext/src/override/override.html).
